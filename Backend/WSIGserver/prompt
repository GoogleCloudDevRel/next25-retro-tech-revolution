Generate a python code that simulate the different events as if it was generated by a real game session. 
Each event can be of a different structure but all needs to be in JSON format. 
Events related to the enemies and the player are generated every second, others are generated when they occur in the game.

Here is a list of events:

- player: a session_id uniquely identifying the game session, position on x,y axis expressed in pixels, current object in hand, current inventory of objects, health level, total number of hits, 
- enemies:  session_id, enemy_id, health, position on x,y axis expressed in pixels, total number of hits, enemy type. 
- events generated when the game adjust the difficulty level.
- events generated when the game give a hint.
- events generated when the player  finds an object.
- events generated when the player start fighting a boss and when it defeats it capturing the session_id, and enemy id.
- events generated when the player start fighting an enemy and when it defeats it capturing the session_id, and enemy id.
- events generated when player change the used object, the button Y is used to cycle through the object inventory.
- events generated when the gamer press a direction button (up, down, left, right).
- events generated when the gamer press a X to use an object.
- events generated when an enemy, boss or player's health is depleted.
-events generated when the level is cleared 
- An event is generated when the player is considered idle when no buttons have been pressed for 5s
Here is more information on how the game is played

The backstory of the game is that the player needs to clean a datacenter that has been invaded by old technologies.
The player needs to go fetch an object that will help him then go defeat the end level boss.
Game finishes if the player's life level is depleated to 0 or if the player kills the boss and clear the level.

The datacenter is made of rows of server racks, the object that needs to be retrieved is in one side of the datacenter 
and the boss to defeat in another.

while going to retrieve the object or going to meet the boss, waves of enemies come at the player.

The datacenter is a square of 13000 by 13000 pixels, the player starts in the upper left corner, with 100 points of health and can walk in any direction: left, right, up, down 
as well as using a weapon. 
Player can move by 5px per second.
By default the player can use the data vacuum but it only take 2 points of life from an enemy.
There is 4 weapons in the game: 
- a shredder: that can shredder punch cards, floppy disks or magnetic tape, take 5 points of life on those enemies and 0 on the 2 other types
- a blower: that can push back enemies, stuns the enemy and make the data vacuum take 7 points of life for 10 seconds
- a universal connector: that can work against a CRT enemy or a modem, only works on those items and remove 5 points of life on those 2 enemy types
- a data vacuum that can suck data out of the enemies, take 2 points of life by default  


The map size is 13000 by 13000 square, player can stop and fight enemies or try to avoid them.

all enemies also move toward the player. 
there is 40 enemies distributed randomly in the datacenter. 
each enemy has 100 in health and move automatically toward the players position at a 3px per second rate. 
Each enemy is assigned an ID which is unique to each game session.
There is 4 types of common enemies:
- a reel tape: that can block the player with its magnetic tape
- a dot matrix printer: that throws paper at the player
- a dialup modem: that uses it s telephone cable as a wip
- a CRT monitor that displays windows blue screens


The end level boss:
- is a punch cards reader that throws punch cards at the player, to defeat him the layer needs to shred the puch card and then vacum data.

Enemies can hit our hero and reduce his health by 5 if in standard mode.
10 points if difficulty is hard and 2 if on the easy mode.

through the game, the difficulty level can be adjusted if the player is not doing well then the game automatically decrease the difficulty
the game also give hints on where to go next

We should be able to manually set the start time and date of a gaming session.
